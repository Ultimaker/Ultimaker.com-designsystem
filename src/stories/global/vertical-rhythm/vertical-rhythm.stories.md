# Vertical rhythm

To ensure a good reading experience and guide the reader through our content we design every pattern based on vertical rhythm. The rhythm is based on multiples or divisions of our building unit.

Ensure that the content is balanced on the baseline grid which you can use to test. Add *'demo-rhythm'* to check the rhythm of your pattern in Patternlab. Most patterns are on rhyhtm by default.

It's not necessary to be on the baseline in every line of text, but in order to feel the balance it should be on the grid within a couple of lines.
