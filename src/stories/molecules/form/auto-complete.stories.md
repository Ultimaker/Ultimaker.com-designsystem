# Auto complete

When we serve a lot of choices, consider using an autocomplete instead of a selectbox or radiobuttons.

- The dropdown shows a single recent or detected item followed by a list of suggestions, controlled by JS.
- A placeholder is used best to tell how many characters the user needs to type before the autocomplete works.
