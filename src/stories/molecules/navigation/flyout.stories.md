# Flyout

The flyout is used to display sub items of a main menu item.
A maximum visible amount for mobile is controlled by JS. On wider screens a maximum amount of items per column is also controlled by JS.

Try the viewport tab to toggle between different types of screens, so you understand how the organism looks like on mobile, tablet and desktop.
