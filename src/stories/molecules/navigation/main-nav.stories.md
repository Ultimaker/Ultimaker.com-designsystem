The main navigation is used to display all menu items on the highest level. It's designed mobile first, but will be switched with JavaScript on larger screens because it needs a different HTML structure in Vue.js.

It will also look different on large touch devices, where an arrow indicates that the menu item has sub items in a flyout menu.

Breakpoints of the main navigation are defined in JavaScript for smooth transitions between small and large main navigation.
