# Justification

Default columns or grid cells are placed next to each other.

It's possible to have a specific spacing between the columns.

* *'Space around'* gives space before and after each column adding up with the next
* *'Space between'* gives space between each pair of columns
* *'Space evenly'* gives as much space before, after and between each column
* *'Justify right'* pushes all columns to the right of the parent flexgrid
