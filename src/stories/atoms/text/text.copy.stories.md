# Copy

Basic textual content is divided into a minimal amount of sizes used to show relations of content. We use:

- *'intro text'* for an introduction of a page.
- *'paragraph text'* is the default if nothing else is defined by classes.
- *'quote text'* is used for inspirational quotes.
- *'Aside text'* is used for small amounts of text related to the surrounding content, like e.g. image captions.
- *'Sub text'* is used to define the smallest elements of copy, like e.g. legal links in the footer.
