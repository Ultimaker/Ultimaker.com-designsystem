Basic textual content is divided into a minimal amount of sizes used to show relations of content.

We use *'intro copy'* for an introduction of a page.

*'Normal paragraph'* copy is the default if nothing else is defined by classes.

And *'small text'* is used for small amounts of text related to the surrounding content, like e.g. image captions.

*'Sub text'* is used to define the smallest elements of copy, like e.g. legal links in the footer.
