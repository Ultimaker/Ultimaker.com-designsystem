# Content link

Seperate links can be grouped as a list or used as a separate link.

We have 2 types of links, *'content links'* and *'icon links'*.

Sizes differ from *'small'*, *'default'* to *'large'*.

Default when links are placed in a textual context, we show an underline to emphasis that it is a link.

## Reversed link
Sometimes we don't want to show that but need visual feedback so the user sees the underline on hover or focus, like e.g. links in the footer. This is when we use a *'reversed link'*.
