# C(ontentfull)Image
This image component implements the [Contentful Images API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/images-api/) 

It also calculates the necessary image boundaries and passes it down to the API.

## focus area
If a content manager can add a focus area to the image, make sure you add the DOM Element property `resize-behavior="fill"` or other appropriate value to the `c-image` element.
