# C(ontentfull)Image

This image component implements the contentful image API 

It also calculates the necessary image boundaries and passes it down to the API.

## focus area
If a content manager can add a focus area to the image, make sure you add the DOM Element property `resize-behavior="crop"` to the `c-image` element.
