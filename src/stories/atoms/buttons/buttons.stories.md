We use 3 kinds of buttons that look the same. If a *'button'* acts like a toggle we use the *Button*,
if a *'button'* leads to another part of the page or another page we use the *Anchor Button*, if we want to submit a form we use *Input button*.

There are 3 different appearances, default, primary and secondary.
The default button can be used multiple times on a page standalone or combined with a secondary button.
The primary button only once on a page as a standalone cta.
The secondary button can be used multiple times on a page standalone or combined with a default button.
