This hero is similar to the *'Product hero'* organism, which provides generic info and a call-to-action to sell the product.
Additionally a section is added to showcase the application area of the specific product.
If used, it should always be positioned as the first organism of the main content. As an introduction of the page.

The hero with application should at least contain a title, full-width image, product image and a price-table.

## Photography guidelines

Photography of the full-width hero image should be in the highest dimensions per breakpoint.

### Sizes full width image:
- 1000 px × 500 px *(small screens)*
- 1200 px × 400 px *(medium screens)*
- 2400 px × 800 px *(medium screens + retina)*
- 1500 px × 400 px *(large screens)*
- 3000 px × 800 px *(large screens + retina)*

### Storytelling:
The full-width image is used to position the product within context or application area.
The photography for positioning printer pages should focus on what kind of prints the 3D printer is making
possible and in what kind of space these printers are made. E.g. the S5 printer is part of the studio line, which means
it should be displayed in the office (studio) space.

The prints it makes possible should be the focus of the photo.
The S5 can be in the photo but should be positioned in the background and blurred.
The focus should be on the prints and application area made possible.


### Clipping and overlay:
Be aware of the product image that will cover a part of the full-width image mainly at the bottom (at the center-bottom on smaller screens as well as at the right-bottom on larger screens).
On the left side there will be text positioned on top of the image.

The image is clipped left and right equally on smaller devices. The larger the screen the more it will show of the image.
To check if and how your image will be cropped you can download a [set with guidelines](/dist/static/media/guides/hero-products-application-cropping-masks.zip) which you can place on top of your image layer in your image-processing software.
