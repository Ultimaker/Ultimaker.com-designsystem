# Hero Video

The 'Video hero’-organism introduces the topic of a page and gives the option to create a link to play video content. If used, this organism should always be positioned as the first organism in a page. The ‘hero video’-organism should at least contain a title, description and background-image. If no video is available, the link to the video will not be displayed.

## Photography guidelines
Storytelling

The full-width image is used to position the topic of the page (being a product or service) and show it in actual use from a customers perspective. The setting can be in an office environment or any other kind of applicable application area.

E.g. when used in the materials overview page it could display a user picking one type of filament out of multiple spools of filament ranging from Ultimaker to other brands. This would communicate the users are choosing a material, based upon their need and shows it is an open filament system. At least one of the Ultimaker spools should be in focus, third party materials and extra Ultimaker spools can be out of focus. 
Clipping and overlay

On small screens the image will be covered by text, so choose contrasting colours compared to the text and choose focus points wisely. On larger viewports the text will be positioned left-aligned and there is enough space to display the focus point at the right side of the image. The image is clipped left and right equally on smaller devices. The larger the screen the more it will show of the image.
Sizes full width image

Photography of the hero product image should be in the highest dimensions per breakpoint in the following dimensions

	•	1000 px × 500 px (small screens)
