# icon button
By default an _icon button_ is as large as the other buttons.

We use 2 kinds of icon buttons that look the same:

* If an _icon button_ acts like a toggle we use the _Icon Button_
* If an _icon button_ leads to another part of the page or another page we use the _Icon Anchor Button_.

Thereâ€™s also a _large_ and a _small_ version for special cases. e.g. in the footer we used a smaller icon button for social icons.
A visual label in the icon button is optional. Although the label is overwritten by the aria-label.
