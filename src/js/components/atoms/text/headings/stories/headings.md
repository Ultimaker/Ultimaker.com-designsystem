# Headings
We use 6 levels of headlines, each serving a semantic purpose.

```html
<h1>a page title</h1>
```

```html
<h2>a title for an organism</h2>
```

```html
<h3>a title for a molecule within an organism</h3>
```

```html
<h4>a title within a paragraph of normal copy</h4>
```

```html
<h5>a title within a paragraph of small copy (e.g. image captions)</h5>
```

```html
<h6>a title with the smallest appearance on the deepest level (e.g. legal in footer)</h6>
```

## Font usage
*h1 - h3* are styled with the secondary font and used as larger headings outside of paragraphs.

*h4 - h6* are styled with the primary font and used inside of paragraphs and smaller text sections like small copy.
