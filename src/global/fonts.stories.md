Text is presented in 2 separate fonts each serving its own purpose.
- The *'primary font'* is the more legible one of the 2 in small font sizes and is used for small text like small copy, body copy or intro text but also small headlines.
- The *'secondary font'* gives character to the Ultimaker brand, but is less legible in smaller fontsizes. Therefore we only use this for larger text like call-to-action links, buttons and larger headlines.
